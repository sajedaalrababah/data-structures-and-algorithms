## Code Challenge 38

### Feature Tasks
#### Write the following method for the Graph class:

- Name: Depth first
- Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
- Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
- Program output: Display the collection

<br>

### Example
```
Root -->  A 
         /  \ 
        B -- D -- F
       /    / \  /
      C     E  H
     /
    G
```

#### Output: 
```
A, B, C, G, D, E, H, F
```

<br>

### Structure and Testing
#### Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
