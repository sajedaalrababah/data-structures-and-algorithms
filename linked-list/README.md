# class 05

Create linked-list that has the following methods:

insert(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the list
includes(value) which returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list
toString() which returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
