 ## Stack and a Queue Implementation

Approach
# Stack methods
push

arguments: value adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

pop

arguments: none Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack Removes the node from the top of the stack Should raise exception when called on empty stack

peek

arguments: none Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack Should raise exception when called on empty stack

is_empty

arguments: none returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

# Queue methods
enqueue

arguments: value adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

dequeue

arguments: none Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue Removes the node from the front of the queue Should raise exception when called on empty queue

peek

arguments: none Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue Should raise exception when called on empty queue

is_empty

arguments: none returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
